  publishKey: process.env.PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY,
  subscribeKey: process.env.PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.PUBNUB_SECRET_KEY
});

// Client-side
import PubNub from 'pubnub';
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: process.env.PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY,
  subscribeKey: process.env.PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY
});
```

**Features:**
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Message storage and replay
- Presence detection
- Functions for serverless computing
- Global data stream network

**Pricing:** $99/month for 1M messages, $499/month for 10M messages

### **Option 3: Self-Hosted Solutions**

#### **A. SocketCluster (Open Source)**
```bash
npm install socketcluster
```

**Features:**
- Horizontal scaling
- Built-in clustering
- Redis integration
- Real-time analytics
- Custom authentication

#### **B. Deepstream (Open Source)**
```bash
npm install deepstream.io
```

**Features:**
- Data synchronization

## üéØ **Recommendations by Use Case**

### **For Immediate Fix (Current Issues)**
- ‚úÖ **Use the fixes I've already applied** - they should resolve 90% of disconnection issues
- Monitor for 1-2 weeks to see improvement

### **For Production Scale (1000+ concurrent users)**
- **Pusher** - Best balance of features, reliability, and cost
- **Ably** - If you need the highest reliability and lowest latency

### **For Enterprise Scale (10,000+ concurrent users)**
- **Ably** - Best for high-scale applications
- **PubNub** - If you need advanced features like message history

### **For Cost-Conscious (Budget < $100/month)**
- **Socket.IO** - Free, good performance, easy migration
- **SocketCluster** - Free, excellent scaling, more setup required

## üîÑ **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Immediate (This Week)**
1. ‚úÖ Deploy the fixes I've applied
2. Monitor connection stability
3. Collect metrics on disconnection frequency

### **Phase 2: Short-term (Next 2-4 weeks)**
1. If issues persist, migrate to Socket.IO
2. Implement proper monitoring and alerting
3. Add connection quality metrics

### **Phase 3: Long-term (Next 1-3 months)**
1. Evaluate enterprise solutions based on growth
2. Implement chosen solution
3. Add advanced features (presence, analytics, etc.)

## üìà **Monitoring & Metrics**

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- Connection success rate
- Average connection duration
- Reconnection frequency
- Message delivery success rate
- Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)

### **Alerting Thresholds:**
- Connection success rate < 95%
- Average connection duration < 5 minutes
- Reconnection frequency > 10% of connections
- Message delivery failure rate > 1%

## üõ†Ô∏è **Next Steps**

1. **Test the current fixes** - Deploy and monitor for 24-48 hours
2. **Collect baseline metrics** - Measure current performance
3. **Choose migration path** - Based on your scale and requirements
4. **Implement monitoring** - Set up proper observability
5. **Plan for scale** - Prepare for future growth

The fixes I've applied should significantly improve your WebSocket stability. If you're still experiencing issues after deployment, I recommend migrating to Socket.IO as the next step, as it's the easiest path to enterprise-grade reliability.
